A simple Python-based game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. This project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

Features
The computer generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
The user is prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the user is informed whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or decides to quit.
Requirements
Python 3.x or later.
How to Run
Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-guessing-game.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd number-guessing-game
Run the game.py script:

bash
Copy code
python game.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number!

Code Walkthrough
Main Logic
The program uses the random module to generate a random number within a specified range (default: 1 to 100). It uses a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for a guess until the correct number is guessed.

Example Interaction
bash
Copy code
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Can you guess what it is?

Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.

Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.

Enter your guess: 62
Correct! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
Customization
You can modify the following settings:

Range: Change the range of numbers (e.g., from 1 to 1000) by editing the lower_bound and upper_bound variables in the script.
Number of Attempts: Add a limit on the number of guesses allowed, or let the user play indefinitely until they guess the correct number.
Contributing
Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve the game. Any suggestions or enhancements are welcome.
